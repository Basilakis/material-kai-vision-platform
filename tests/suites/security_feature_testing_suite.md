# Security Feature Testing Suite for Phase 8 Launch Readiness

## Overview

This comprehensive Security Feature Testing Suite validates all security implementations within the Material Kai Vision Platform to ensure MVP launch readiness. The suite covers six critical security domains with automated test execution, vulnerability scanning, and compliance validation.

### Security Testing Domains

1. **JWT Authentication & Authorization** - Workspace-aware authentication system
2. **Rate Limiting & Throttling** - Production-ready request throttling (50 req/60s)
3. **File Validation & Security** - PDF validation and malicious file detection
4. **Input Sanitization & Validation** - SQL injection and XSS protection
5. **Workspace Isolation** - Multi-tenant data separation
6. **API Security** - CORS, HTTPS, and security headers
