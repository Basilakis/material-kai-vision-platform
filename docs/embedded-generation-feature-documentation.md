# Embedded Generation Feature Documentation

## Overview

The **Embedded Generation** feature is a sophisticated vector embedding system that powers semantic search and AI-enhanced functionality across the Material Kai Vision Platform. It converts text content into numerical vector representations (embeddings) that enable intelligent content discovery, similarity matching, and context-aware AI interactions.

## What It Does

### Core Functionality
- **Vector Embedding Generation**: Converts materials catalog content and knowledge base articles into 1536-dimensional vector embeddings using OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` model
- **Semantic Search**: Enables finding content based on meaning rather than just keyword matching
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: Provides contextual information to AI models for more accurate and relevant responses
- **Similarity Matching**: Identifies related materials and content based on semantic similarity

### Technical Components

#### 1. Database Schema
- **`material_embeddings`** table: Stores vector embeddings for materials catalog
  - Supports both 512D and 1536D vectors
  - Includes vector similarity search functions
  - Optimized with vector indexes for fast retrieval

- **`enhanced_knowledge_base`** table: Advanced knowledge base with multiple embedding types
  - OpenAI embeddings (1536D)
  - HuggingFace embeddings
  - Custom embedding support
  - Full-text search integration

- **`document_chunks`** table: Chunked document content with embeddings
  - 1536D OpenAI embeddings
  - Supports large document processing

#### 2. Edge Functions
- **`enhanced-rag-search`**: Advanced RAG search functionality with embedding-based retrieval
- **`rag-knowledge-search`**: Knowledge base search using vector embeddings

#### 3. Frontend Components
- **`EmbeddingGenerationPanel.tsx`**: Admin dashboard component for monitoring and managing embeddings
  - Shows statistics for materials and knowledge base embeddings
  - Provides regeneration functionality
  - Real-time status monitoring

## Where It's Used

- **Search**: Fast similarity search with configurable thresholds

### Processing Pipeline
1. **Content Ingestion**: Materials and documents are processed
2. **Text Extraction**: Relevant text content is extracted
3. **Chunking**: Large documents are split into manageable chunks
4. **Embedding Generation**: Text is converted to vectors using OpenAI API
5. **Storage**: Embeddings are stored with metadata in the database
6. **Indexing**: Vector indexes are created for fast retrieval

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Components

```

### Optional Configuration
```bash
OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small  # Default model
EMBEDDING_BATCH_SIZE=100                        # Batch processing size
EMBEDDING_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3                      # Retry logic
```

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Improved Search**: Find materials based on meaning, not just keywords
