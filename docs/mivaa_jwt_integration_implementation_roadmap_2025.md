# Mivaa-JWT Integration Implementation Roadmap 2025

## Executive Summary üéØ

This roadmap provides a comprehensive, prioritized implementation plan for integrating the existing Mivaa PDF extractor service with the Material Kai Vision Platform's JWT authentication system and achieving complete platform unification. The roadmap addresses five critical integration gaps identified through architectural analysis and provides a phased approach to implementation.

**Key Discovery**: Analysis revealed that 80-85% of the planned functionality already exists in a production-ready state, reducing estimated development time by 60-75%. The focus shifts from building new functionality to strategic integration and security hardening.

## Current State Assessment üìä

### ‚úÖ Existing Assets (Production Ready)
- **Complete Mivaa PDF Extractor Service**: FastAPI application with PyMuPDF4LLM integration
- **Comprehensive JWT Integration Architecture**: Detailed technical specifications documented
- **Existing RAG System**: Functional vector search and document processing pipeline
- **Database Infrastructure**: Supabase with workspace-aware schema foundation
- **Deployment Infrastructure**: Docker containerization and deployment configurations

### ‚ùå Critical Integration Gaps
1. **Security Vulnerability**: Mivaa service lacks JWT authentication middleware
2. **Database Schema Conflicts**: Incompatible table structures between Mivaa and existing system
3. **Embedding Model Inconsistency**: Dimension mismatch (1536 vs 768) between models
4. **Multi-tenant Isolation**: Missing workspace-aware security policies
5. **Data Flow Integration**: No bridge between Mivaa output and existing RAG system
