# Week 2: Parallel Processing & Vector Optimization Implementation Plan

## Overview

Building on Week 1's embedding model upgrade and caching infrastructure, Week 2 focuses on implementing parallel document processing pipelines and optimizing vector storage and search performance. This phase will dramatically improve throughput and reduce latency for the Material Kai Vision Platform's RAG system.

## Objectives

- **Primary**: Implement parallel document processing pipelines
- **Secondary**: Optimize pgvector index configurations and queries
- **Tertiary**: Add batch processing capabilities for large document sets
- **Quaternary**: Implement vector compression and storage optimization

## Technical Architecture

### Current State Limitations
- Sequential document processing (one document at a time)
- Basic pgvector configuration with default settings
- No batch processing for multiple documents
- Unoptimized vector storage consuming excessive space

### Target State Benefits
- Parallel processing of multiple documents simultaneously
- Optimized pgvector indexes for sub-100ms search times
- Batch processing supporting 100+ documents per operation
- 50% reduction in vector storage requirements through compression

## Implementation Tasks

```

#### Task 1.2: Supabase Edge Function Optimization
**Estimated Time**: 6 hours  
**Assignee**: Backend Engineer

  const batchSize = 5;
  const results = [];
  
  for (let i = 0; i < chunks.length; i += batchSize) {
    const batch = chunks.slice(i, i + batchSize);
    const batchResults = await Promise.all(
      batch.map(chunk => embeddingService.getEmbedding(chunk))
    );
    results.push(...batchResults);
  }
  
  return results;
};
```

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_document_embeddings_vector_hnsw 
ON document_embeddings 
USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops) 
WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);

-- Partial indexes for frequently accessed data
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_document_embeddings_recent 
ON document_embeddings (created_at, embedding) 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Composite index for filtered searches
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_document_embeddings_type_vector 
ON document_embeddings (document_type, embedding) 
USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
```

**Performance Tuning**:
