# ADR-001: Deployment Platform Selection for Material Kai Vision Platform

## Status
**ACCEPTED** - 2025-07-17

## Context

The Material Kai Vision Platform is a sophisticated React/TypeScript application with the following technical characteristics:

### Project Requirements
- **Frontend Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI components + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Supabase (already hosting edge functions)
- **AI/ML Workloads**: Hugging Face Transformers for material recognition
- **3D Visualization**: Three.js and React Three Fiber for material rendering
- **Build Tool**: Vite with SWC for fast compilation
- **Bundle Size**: ~70+ dependencies requiring careful optimization

### Deployment Requirements
- Seamless integration with existing Supabase edge functions
- Support for large JavaScript bundles (AI/ML libraries)
- Global CDN for 3D assets and material recognition models
- Fast build and deployment cycles
- Cost-effective scaling for bandwidth-intensive workloads

## Decision

**We will deploy the Material Kai Vision Platform on Vercel.**

## Rationale

### Evaluation Criteria & Scoring
| **Criteria** | **Weight** | **Vercel** | **Netlify** | **Cloudflare Workers** |
|--------------|------------|------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **AI/ML Performance** | 25% | 8/10 | 6/10 | 9/10 |
| **3D Asset Delivery** | 20% | 7/10 | 7/10 | 9/10 |
| **Supabase Integration** | 20% | 9/10 | 8/10 | 7/10 |
| **Developer Experience** | 15% | 9/10 | 8/10 | 6/10 |
| **Scalability & Cost** | 10% | 7/10 | 7/10 | 9/10 |
| **Bundle Size Handling** | 10% | 6/10 | 7/10 | 5/10 |

**Final Weighted Scores:**
- **Vercel: 7.85/10**
- **Netlify: 7.15/10**
- **Cloudflare Workers: 7.70/10**

### Key Decision Factors

#### 1. Ecosystem Synergy (Critical)
- **Vercel + Supabase + React** forms a proven, well-integrated stack
- Native support for Vite builds with zero-configuration deployment
- Seamless edge function interoperability with existing Supabase infrastructure

#### 2. Developer Experience (High Priority)
- Zero-config deployment accelerates development velocity
- Excellent GitHub integration with automatic preview deployments
- Built-in analytics and performance monitoring
- Familiar deployment model reducing learning curve

#### 3. AI/ML Optimization (High Priority)
- Good handling of large JavaScript bundles required for Hugging Face Transformers
- Intelligent code splitting and tree-shaking capabilities
- Edge runtime support for performance-critical AI workloads

#### 4. Risk Mitigation (Medium Priority)
- Lower complexity reduces deployment and maintenance overhead
- Established platform with strong community support
- Clear migration path if requirements change

## Alternatives Considered

### Netlify
**Pros:**
- Excellent static site hosting with good React SPA support
- Competitive edge functions with Deno runtime
- Strong build performance with incremental deployments

**Cons:**
- Less optimized for heavy AI/ML client-side workloads
- 50MB function size limit may constrain future AI features
- Slightly less seamless Supabase integration

### Cloudflare Workers
**Pros:**
- Unmatched global performance (<50ms latency)
- Excellent WebAssembly support for AI/ML optimization
- Unlimited bandwidth ideal for 3D asset delivery
- Advanced edge caching capabilities

**Cons:**
- Requires manual configuration for React SPA routing
- 1MB worker script limit necessitates careful bundle optimization
- Steeper learning curve and different deployment paradigm
- More complex integration with existing Supabase setup

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Initial Deployment
1. **Bundle Optimization**: Implement code splitting and tree-shaking to meet 50MB limit
2. **Vercel Configuration**: Set up `vercel.json` with appropriate build settings
3. **Environment Variables**: Migrate Supabase configuration to Vercel environment
4. **Domain Setup**: Configure custom domain with SSL

### Phase 2: Performance Optimization
1. **Edge Functions**: Leverage Vercel Edge Functions for performance-critical operations
2. **Asset Optimization**: Implement intelligent caching for 3D models and AI assets
3. **Monitoring**: Set up performance monitoring and alerting
4. **CDN Configuration**: Optimize global asset delivery

### Mitigation Strategies

#### Bundle Size Management
- Implement dynamic imports for AI/ML libraries
- Use Vite's code splitting capabilities
- Regular bundle analysis and optimization
- Consider moving heavy AI processing to Supabase edge functions if needed

#### Cost Management
- Monitor bandwidth usage and implement caching strategies
- Use Vercel's analytics to optimize resource allocation
- Plan for scaling costs in project budget

#### Performance Monitoring
- Implement Core Web Vitals tracking
- Monitor AI/ML processing performance
- Set up alerts for deployment failures or performance degradation

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Faster Time-to-Market**: Zero-config deployment accelerates development cycles
- **Reduced Complexity**: Simplified deployment and maintenance workflows
- **Better Integration**: Seamless Supabase edge function compatibility
- **Developer Productivity**: Familiar tooling and excellent DX

### Negative
- **Bundle Size Constraints**: 50MB limit requires ongoing optimization efforts
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Moderate dependency on Vercel-specific features
- **Cost Scaling**: Potential for higher costs at scale compared to Cloudflare Workers

### Neutral
- **Performance Trade-offs**: Good but not optimal global performance compared to Cloudflare
- **Feature Limitations**: Some advanced edge computing features may require future migration

## Monitoring & Review

### Success Metrics
- **Deployment Time**: < 5 minutes for typical deployments
- **Build Success Rate**: > 99% successful deployments
- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals within acceptable ranges
- **Cost Efficiency**: Monthly hosting costs within budget projections

### Review Schedule
- **3-Month Review**: Assess performance metrics and cost efficiency
- **6-Month Review**: Evaluate bundle size management and scaling needs
- **Annual Review**: Consider alternative platforms based on evolved requirements

### Exit Criteria
If any of the following occur, reconsider this decision:
- Bundle size consistently exceeds 45MB despite optimization efforts
- Monthly costs exceed 150% of budget projections
- Performance requirements necessitate global edge computing capabilities
- Supabase integration becomes problematic or deprecated
